# Numeral Systems

**A numeral system is a set of rules for writing numbers. Using different numeral systems, the same value can be written in many ways, using different sets of symbols (digits) and rules for their use.**

To better illustrate the differences between numeral systems, let's try to write the answer to the ultimate question about life, the universe, and everything in several ways:
- unary system: $||||\\ ||||\\ ||||\\ ||||\\ ||||\\ ||||\\ ||||\\ ||||\\ ||$
- Roman system: $XLII$ (formerly $XXXXII$)
- decimal system: $42$
- binary system: $101010$
- octal system: $52$
- hexadecimal system: $2A$

Numeral systems can be divided into two basic groups, depending on whether the position of a symbol (digit) affects the final value of the written number:
- Sign-value notation: the position of a digit does not matter
- Positional notation: the position of a digit in the notation affects the value of the number
